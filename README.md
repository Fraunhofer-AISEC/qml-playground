# Quantum Machine Learning Playground

The **Quantum Machine Learning (QML) Playground** is an interactive web application designed to visualize the inner workings of quantum machine learning models in an intuitive and educational manner. Inspired by classical tools like TensorFlow Playground, it focuses on parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) and particularly the *data re-uploading universal quantum classifier*, offering visual metaphors like Bloch spheres and the novel Q-simplex for interpreting quantum state evolution.

This playground is ideal for learners, educators, and researchers who want to explore QML models without deep expertise in quantum computing hardware or simulation backends.

## üß† How the Quantum Classifier Works

The playground demonstrates the **data re-uploading quantum classifier**, a variational quantum algorithm introduced by P√©rez-Salinas et al. ([Quantum, 2020](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-02-06-226/)). This architecture repeatedly embeds classical features into quantum states using trainable quantum gates ‚Äî mimicking the depth and expressivity of classical neural networks.

This classifier was chosen because its structure:

- Closely resembles other commonly used **variational quantum circuit (VQC)** architectures  
- Is **simple enough to visualize intuitively**  
- Is **powerful enough to be universal**, meaning it can approximate any function in principle (akin to the universal approximation theorem in classical ML)

This makes it the ideal model for educational purposes and for understanding how quantum learning systems process information at the level of quantum state evolution.
